#### Projects:

- MVC App Code Retrospective:  This project involved work on two different MVC Web Apps with a group of developers.  Here, you will find my code retrospective, outlining the work I contributed and what I gained from the experience.

- Moving Mountains:  This is a web app project in it's birth phase.  I am working on moving my hiking journal that I have kept in excel into a web application environment for better planning and tracking of all of the hikes that I do.
