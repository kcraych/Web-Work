### LIVE PROJECTS OVERVIEW

The final month of my experience with the Tech Academy program consisted of work on live projects, in which I collaborated with teammates to build out two code-first MVC web applications to be used by the Tech Academy.  There were many benefits to working on this project, namely the opportunity to research new concepts in both front and back end development, put them to practice, and effectively debug errors.  For an overview of technical work I accomplished during each two week sprint for the two projects, please click the links below.

On top of the technical skills practiced, working on a group project uses a soft skill-set to a much larger degree when compared to working individually. I found it most beneficial to be able to see how other developers were approaching similar problems, such that I could compare my own solution and weigh out the pros and cons of each method.  This was a great way to practice balancing efficiency, accuracy, dynamic functionality, and readability.  Additionally, working with a project manager and a team of developers lended valuable insights into the layers of good project management. Overall, there are many soft skills to be practiced while working in a group project and below are a few more that were top of my mind during these projects.

- Daily communication with a team of developers to align on accomplishments, road blocks, and project ideas.
- Brainstorming and debugging with other developers to find the most effective solutions possible.
- Collaboration on tasks to create the bigger the whole in an efficient and manageable way.
- Practiced good version control on group project, including merging conflicts.

Technical and soft-skills combined, these group projects provided a valuable experience which I would not get on individual projects.  For this, I entered projects which were already well under way, got quickly aquainted with the development completed thus far, molded my techniques and code around what other teammates were contributing, and understood that I could complete my work without being an expert on the entirity of the project.  In summary, teamwork makes the dreamwork!
