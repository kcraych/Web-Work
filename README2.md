### Project Description:

I love, love, love hiking and really anything mountain related. Last year, I created a google spreadsheet to track hikes I want to do, hikes I've done, in additon to random other mountain related activities. This project encompasses transitioning this googlesheet tracking into a more functional web app where I can keep track of mountain activities I have done or want to do, with a primary focus on hikes. I will set this up with individual login and unit testing for additional skills practice.

For reference, here is a link to the googlesheets I've been using for tracking: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yfPjKAQV-hWEXFBB-GO4YmraNHkvbWcnHtaXMsbdikM/edit?usp=sharing.

### Project Planning:

As I already had an google spreadsheet file tracking my hiking activity, I used this as my basis of this project. This file contains my database model preparations in addition to my seed data.
